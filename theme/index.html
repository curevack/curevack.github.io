        So you wanted to get to know some of the silver screen slashers, the classics, the spooks and goofs we've all
        gotten to know by attending their original releases, seeing the abundant remakes, or a plethora of other sources? Well, lucky 
        you! You came to the right place, and the right time, unlike most of the teens in these characters movies. 
        Here we'll be going over a few of them, their history, their movies, and their powers, all in all the nitty gritty that we've learned to love!

        <p class="pcolorfont">Below this are hyperlinks to separate pages that will focus and go further in detail about Michael Myers, 
          Freddy Krueger, Leatherface, honorable mentions in the slasher film genre, and some fun facts about the characters 
          and movies! Sit back, and have fun with the adventure. I will not be responsible for any of the terror you may feel 
          while reading this information. I know that it can be scary but don't worry, this site is here to hold your hand.
