                <h3 class="subheading">Michael's Past</h3>
                <p class="pcolorfont2">In Haddonfield, Illinois, the dark twist in a seemingly normal boy's life begins
                    on the night of Halloween in 1963. That night, a six year old Michael Myers stabs his sister, Judith, to death with a 
                    large kitchen knife after waiting for her boyfriend to leave the house. The deed was done presumably because Michael 
                    was upset with his sister for choosing coitas with her boyfriend over taking him out to trick or treat. After  
                    comitting the fratricide young Michael waits for his parents arrival home, sitting on the front porch with a calm demeanor. 
                </p>
                <p class="pcolorfont2">He was admitted to a psychiatric ward from then, never uttering a word since the night he murdered his older sister.
                    After 15 years there, he escapes and finds his way to Haddonfield with his younger sister, Laurie, as his target. From there he begins a slew 
                    of murders on the night of Halloween to get to her.

            <section id="powers">
                <h3 class="subheading">Michael's Capabilities</h3>
                <p class="pcolorfont2">The powers Michael possesses are almost identical between timelines in the movies but the explanations for them differ. 
                    The first continuity or timeline being the first six movies; <em>Halloween</em> (1978) - <em>Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers</em> (1995). 
                    In this timeframe his supernatural abilities of dissappearing and reappearing in different places, seeming immortality and endless stamina, 
                    and inhuman strength all come from a curse placed upon him, specifically, the Curse of Thorn. Bearers of the curse are fueled 
                    by an inner rage to kill family members, thus the hunt for his last living relative, Laurie, being an attempt to lift it through her murder. 
                </p>
                <p class="pcolorfont2"> The rest of the movies hold a different timeline or continuity of events connecting from the first movie, but all 
                    present his powers similarly, just lack an explanation for them unlike the first six.
