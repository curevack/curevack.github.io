                        <p class="pcolorfont2">In the 1940's, just a few nights before Christmas, a nun by the name of Amanda Krueger 
                            was accidently locked inside of a cell filled with 100 psychotic men. She was raped countless times until she 
                            finally was released, this tragic event lead to the birth of Freddy. Not willing to raise the child, Amanda left 
                            him at an orphange.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pcolorfont2">Throughout his childhood Freddy was thrown from orphanage to orphanage, humiliated constantly 
                            by other children who saw him as a freak. Soon nicknamed by his young abusers as the "Son of 100 Maniacs." His abuse 
                            doesn't cease there, after being adopted by a Mr. Underwood (a terrible alcholic) he faced torment mentally and physically 
                            until he snapped and retaliated by murdering his father with razor blades as a teen. He soon moved to Springwood, Ohio to 
                            get a fresh environment.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pcolorfont2">All was not well though, with his arrival to Springwood Freddy grew into his adulthood as a secret 
                            child murderer. He killed dozens of children there, bringing them all to his old place of work, a boiler room inside of an old power plant, and using his signature clawed glove. 
                            These actions earned him the alias "Springwood Slasher" and it was a secret that no one would uncover, until his wife, Loretta, caught wind. 
                            Freddy strangled her in an attempt to keep it secret, but he did so in front of their child, Kathryn, who also knew but promised not to tell. 
                            However, Kathryn did blow the whistle, and soon after Fredrick was arrested only to be released due and no means of a retrial due to a 
                            documentation error with a warrant.
                        </p>
                        <p class="pcolorfont2"> Upon release, Freddy prepared to leave town in his boiler room but not before one last celebratory kill, a little girl. Soon he was tracked down by a lynch mob of 
                            furious parents that sought retribution upon him. Their justice was lighting his boiler room on fire, and murdering him in the flames of molotovs. Thinking this was the end, the families 
                            turned back toward home but before dying, three dream demons approached Freddy and made a deal with him that resulted in his return. Not as a living being, but as a manevolent spirit made 
                            immortal with the capability to enter and kill through dreams. Freddy continued his spree, with almost no one to stop him.

                        <p class="pcolorfont2">Prior to his death as a human, Fredrick beared no special powers or supernatural skills, he 
                            was just a serial killer who targeted children. Upon almost dying, Freddy took a deal with three dream demons and 
                            gained immortality, but as a spirit. He took the mantle as a dream demon, and with his immortality gained the ability 
                            to enter dreams of any person. When inside of a dream, any damage he inflicted upon them there, took place in real life. 
                            With each kill Freddy absorbed the deceased's soul, and on top of that with the fear from the living, he grew in power.
