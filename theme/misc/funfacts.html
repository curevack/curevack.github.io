                    <p class="pfontright">The script for <em>Halloween</em> (1978) actually never called for a 
                        specific kind of mask. It had a description that was very general, and it ultimately ended 
                        being the reason that a Captain Kirk mask was bleached and stretched to eventually be used in the movie!
                        <em>Star Trek</em> but with a serial killer-y vibe, oof, imagine Michael floating in space!

                <p class="p-leftside">Wes Craven apparently planned to have a stuntman play the role of our hilarious
                    dream demon, but instead tried going for the smarter pic of David Warner. Fortunately for us 
                    Warner wasn't interested or he was busy because he passed on the project and from there 
                    iconic Englund sat on his Kruegar throne! Although maybe the movies needed more Titanic?

                <h3 class="subheading">Leatherface Was Inspired?</h3>
                <p class="pfontright">Apparently one guy, Ed Gein, managed to be an inspiration for not one,
                    or two, but three horror movies! Who would have thought being a real life serial killer 
                    who made masks and decorations with human parts, was a cannibal, and grave robber would make
                    such good content! Our big guy Jed sure takes a lot from this fella...
