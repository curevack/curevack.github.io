                <p class="pfontright">How could anyone write about Slasher films and not mention the destructive mommas boy?
                Terrorizing Crystal lake ever since he grew up in the wilderness after witnessing his mom die to the hands of 
                a counselor she was trying to kill. Crazy and hearing his mom's voice everywhere, Jason can't stop killing counselors. That is one 
                ki ki ki-lling story!

                <h3 class="subheading-center">Ghostface</h3>
                <p class="pfontright">The prepare for trouble, and make it double slasher of the more modern-day screens! 
                    Instead of the usual ridiculous psycho that's seen in the genre, Ghostface brought a little 
                    realism, as much as a slasher can, by employing a double killer aspect to the antagonist. 
                    Always a different duo in every movie of the franchise, how all of them know what I 
                    did last Summer? I'll never know.

                <p class="pfontright">Bad dude, immortal inside of a doll after almost dying, and then going around like 
                    Stewie with free-reign causing multiples of murders. Now after a boy that has been instutionalized after 
                    trying to report this black magic criminals new found body, this killer's like a horror based <em>Freaky Friday</em>
                    that can't not be mentioned for its silly tone and comedic kills.
