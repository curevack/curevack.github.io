                <h4>My Interests & Hobbies</h4>
                <p>I have a strong fascination towards programming/computer science, and my desire to learn it only grows. Past

            <p class="pabout">Greetings! I assume you are here because obviously you are so enthralled with the 
                informative and captivating nature of my thematic site about slashers that you needed to see and 
                learn about the amazing writer? Well, I am 19, attending my 2nd year of Bellevue College, and 
                the main purpose of my choice in slashers as a theme is just the nostalgia aspect to them and the fun
                sarcasm I can impose in my writing with the silliness that they are. This was a step towards furthered 
                HTML5 and CSS3 understanding, formatting, and creation in a particularly fun way.
