                        <p class="pcolorfont2">Jedidiah Sawyer has no direct history or explanation of childhood, but the Sawyer family and Jed hold 
                            a dark secret that everyone in their town knows quite well. The Sawyers are a tight knit family that use Jed or otherwise known as 
                            Leatherface (nickname given because he wears real faces) as the brawn of their family. Shown to be primarily acting in self-defense, 
                            Jed cares for his family even though he has been abused and quite evidently neglected with his lack of knowledge on even the most basic 
                            aspects of humanity. He and his family are a group of cannibals who fool and capture visitors through a ploy of Jeds brother pretending 
                            to be a hitchhiker. Cannibalizing, and fashioning the parts into furniture is just simply the way this family bonds.

                        <p class="pcolorfont2">Jed' fame is almost as good as his chili, bolstering a good count, definitely not because he is the main antagonist
                            in <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> series!</p>

                        <p class="pcolorfont2">Although Jed has not been shown to have any supernatural capabilities, he does possess on some sense inhuman strength. 
                            Countless times on screen he has been shown effortlessly swinging and running for long durations with a big chainsaw, and also shows remarkable skill 
                            with a hammer. Aside from strength, this Sawyer is running long and fast even when lugging a big chainsaw in his hands. Best stay off his property!
